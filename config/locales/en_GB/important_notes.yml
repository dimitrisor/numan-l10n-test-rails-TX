        Please note that sildenafil can interact with a number of other drugs. If you do present to any other healthcare
        professional, your GP or a pharmacist you must tell them that you are taking sildenafil. If you suffer from any
        chest pain in the future and call an ambulance, visit your GP or go to A&E, it's essential that you tell the
        doctor, nurse, paramedic or other healthcare professional if you have taken sildenafil in the previous 24 hours.
        Sildenafil can interact with medication known as GTN (glyceryl trinitrate), which is often used to treat extreme
        tightness in the chest, sometimes called cardiac chest pain. Taking both of these medicines at the same time can

        "<b>An important note:</b>
        <br>
        Hair loss treatments work differently for each person. Depending on what kind of hair loss you are experiencing,
        you might not notice a significant improvement for about 4-6 months. It can be frustrating if your treatment
        does not work perfectly right away, but it’s important to give this treatment the time it needs to take effect.
        <br><br>
        Finasteride is a daily tablet that prevents male pattern baldness on a hormonal level. It is known as a DHT
        (dihydrotestosterone) blocker. DHT is a hormone that binds to men’s hair follicles and damages them, ultimately
        rendering them unable to grow new hair. Finasteride works by inhibiting production of 5α-Reductase, the enzyme
        that converts testosterone into DHT within your body.
        <br><br>
        Studies show that finasteride can lower your DHT levels by 71.4% when taken at a hair loss prevention dose. As
        well as stopping hair loss, finasteride can cause some of your “lost” hair to gradually regrow over time making
        it quite an effective treatment.
        <br><br>
        Uncommon side effects of Finasteride include:
        <br>
        -Sexual dysfunction such as impotence, loss of interest in sex, trouble having an orgasm
        <br>
        -Swelling or tenderness in breasts

        -Mood changes

        so that we can discuss your options. Any side effects experienced are usually reversible on stopping.
        <br><br>
        It is important to be aware that stopping treatment with finasteride, once established, will cause any new hair
        growth to reverse and restart the cycle of progressive hair loss.

        Finasteride decreases PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) levels in the blood. A PSA Test is taken when screening
        for prostate cancer.  If you have a PSA test done you should tell your healthcare provider that you are taking
        Finasteride so that they can interpret your results accordingly. You should also tell your healthcare provider
        if you have not been taking Finasteride as prescribed because this may affect the PSA test results. For more

        <br><br>
        Minoxidil is a topical spray medication that promotes hair growth. It works by stimulating your hair follicles
        to enter the growth phase, increasing blood flow to your hair and helping to transport essential nutrients to
        your hair follicles. Unlike finasteride, minoxidil doesn’t affect DHT and has no effects on your production of
        hormones. Like finasteride, it’s backed up by a huge amount of scientific evidence, with studies showing a
        significant increase in hair growth after several months of use.
        <br><br>
        One of the most common side effects of minoxidil use is initial rapid hair loss or shedding. This is a temporary
        effect that happens as your resting hairs shed. Once they’re replaced with new hairs, minoxidil can produce a
        noticeably thicker head of hair.
        <br><br>
        Do not apply minoxidil to areas of the body other than the scalp, and wash your hands thoroughly after applying
        the solution.

            before sexual activity and not more than once every 24 hours.</li>
        <li>There are some rare, but serious side effects of Priligy that you need to be aware of. You should seek
            urgent medical advice if you notice any changes in your mood, including thoughts of harming yourself, or
            suicide. Priligy can cause your blood pressure levels to drop, which might make you feel dizzy or faint.
            Please stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately if you have fits or faints, or feel dizzy
            on standing up. To avoid this happening, ensure that you drink plenty of water whilst taking the treatment,
            and do not take Priligy if you may be dehydrated, e.g. following alcohol, or any illness where you have
            vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating or a fever.</li>
        <li>Priligy can also cause headaches which are very common. These should go away with time, BUT if these

        Priligy must only be used with caution if taken at the same time as medicines for erectile dysfunction. This is
        because both Priligy and sildenafil/tadalafil lower your blood pressure. If you take the medicines together, the
        combined effect could reduce your blood pressure to a low enough level that symptoms like fainting will occur.
        As a result, the safety of the medications when taken together has not been tested in clinical trials.
        <br><br>
        To avoid this potential side effect, please leave at least 24 hours between taking Priligy and Sildenafil and at

         At the beginning of your minoxidil journey  initial rapid hair loss or shedding can occur. This is a temporary
         effect that happens as your resting hairs shed. Once they’re replaced with new hairs, minoxidil can produce a
         noticeably thicker beard.
         <br><br>
         Do not apply minoxidil to areas of the body other than the beard, avoid applying to any red or inflamed skin,
         and wash your hands thoroughly after applying the solution.

        Hair loss treatments work differently for each person. Depending on what kind of hair loss you are experiencing,

        does not work perfectly right away, but it’s important to give this treatment the time it needs to take effect.
        <br><br>
        Finasteride is a daily tablet that prevents male pattern baldness on a hormonal level. It is known as a DHT
        (dihydrotestosterone) blocker. DHT is a hormone that binds to men’s hair follicles and damages them, ultimately
        rendering them unable to grow new hair. Finasteride works by inhibiting production of 5α-Reductase, the enzyme
        that converts testosterone into DHT within your body.
        <br><br>
        Studies show that finasteride can lower your DHT levels by 71.4% when taken at a hair loss prevention dose. As
        well as stopping hair loss, finasteride can cause some of your “lost” hair to gradually regrow over time making
        it quite an effective treatment.
        <br><br>
        Uncommon side effects of Finasteride include:
        <br>
        -Sexual dysfunction such as impotence, loss of interest in sex, trouble having an orgasm

        -Swelling or tenderness in breasts

        <li>The effects of Priligy will last for up to four hours, therefore you should take Priligy one to three hours
            before sexual activity and not more than once every 24 hours.</li>
        <li>There are some rare, but serious side effects of Priligy that you need to be aware of. You should seek
            urgent medical advice if you notice any changes in your mood, including thoughts of harming yourself, or
            suicide. Priligy can cause your blood pressure levels to drop, which might make you feel dizzy or faint.
            Please stop taking the medication and consult a doctor immediately if you have fits or faints, or feel dizzy
            on standing up. To avoid this happening, ensure that you drink plenty of water whilst taking the treatment,
            and do not take Priligy if you may be dehydrated, e.g. following alcohol, or any illness where you have
            vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating or a fever.</li>
        <li>Priligy can also cause headaches which are very common. These should go away with time, BUT if these
            headaches persist, please stop the medication and seek medical help.</li>
        <li>After the first month's treatment please book a
            <a href='https://calendly.com/numanclinic/free-follow-up-consultation?back=1&month=2021-06'>telephone consultation</a>
            so we can have a discussion about how you got on before continuing further treatment.</li>
        <li>You might need to switch to a different treatment or different dose and you can contact our clinical team at
            any time to discuss your treatment options, through <a href='mailto:clinic@numan.com'>clinic@numan.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        Finding the right solution can be a process, but we are here to help you get there.
        <br><br>
        Additional important safety information:
        <br><br>
        Priligy must only be used with caution if taken at the same time as medicines for erectile dysfunction. This is
        because both Priligy and sildenafil/tadalafil lower your blood pressure. If you take the medicines together, the
        combined effect could reduce your blood pressure to a low enough level that symptoms like fainting will occur.
        As a result, the safety of the medications when taken together has not been tested in clinical trials.
        <br><br>
        To avoid this potential side effect, please leave at least 24 hours between taking Priligy and Sildenafil and at
        least 48 hours between taking Priligy and Tadalafil."

        find you need to use the salbutamol reliever more than 4 times in a week this suggests that you need a change in
        preventer medication. In that case please get in touch via <a href='mailto:clinic@numan.com'>clinic@numan.com</a>.
        I have prescribed an initial 3 months. You will receive an inhaler each month for 3 months and thereafter please
        fill out another asthma consultation so we can review your asthma control.

        If at any time you experience persistent or worsening shortness of breath despite your inhalers you must seek

      salbutamol:
        "
        Salbutamol is your reliever inhaler and should only be used on occasions when you need extra relief from asthma
        symptoms. If your asthma is well controlled and you are using your regular preventer inhaler you should not need
        more than 1 salbutamol inhaler every 3-6 months. If you run out please get in touch through
        <a href='mailto:clinic@numan.com'>clinic@numan.com</a> and we can review the frequency of your salbutamol.

        "Beard growth treatments work differently for each person, it can take 4-6 months of regular use to see the full
         effects and notice a significant improvement in your beard growth. It can be frustrating if your treatment does
         not work perfectly right away, but it's important to give this treatment the time it needs to take effect.
         <br><br>
         Minoxidil is a topical spray medication that promotes beard growth. It works by stimulating your hair follicles
         to enter the growth phase, increasing blood flow to your hair and helping to transport essential nutrients to
         your hair follicles.
         <br><br>
         At the beginning of your minoxidil journey  initial rapid hair loss or shedding can occur. This is a temporary
         effect that happens as your resting hairs shed. Once they’re replaced with new hairs, minoxidil can produce a
         noticeably thicker beard.
         <br><br>
         Do not apply minoxidil to areas of the body other than the beard, avoid applying to any red or inflamed skin,
         and wash your hands thoroughly after applying the solution.
         <br><br>
         If you experience  any side effects, the most common is dry flakey skin, please stop using minoxidil and
         contact us on <a href='mailto:clinic@numan.com'>clinic@numan.com</a> so that we can discuss your options.
